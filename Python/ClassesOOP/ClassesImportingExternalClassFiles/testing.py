# Import the shapes class:
import shapes

# If we just wanted to import the individual classes we can:
# from shapes import Rectangle
# from shapes import Shape

# Create a new shape:
s1 = shapes.Shape(4, 8)

# Output the shape:
print("The value of s1: ")
print(s1)
print(" ")

# Create a new Rectangle shape:
r1 = shapes.Rectangle(5, 10, 6, 8)

# Output the Rect:
print("The value of r1: ")
print(r1)
