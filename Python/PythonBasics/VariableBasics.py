# Variable Basics

# Comments: We can use the # but also can use the triple quote:
""" 
This is a multi line

# Create Variables:
a = 12
b = 3

# Divide and display as whole number, no decimal:
print(a // b)

# Divide and display w/ decimal place:
print(a / b)

# Printing Hello 5 times:
print("Hello" * 5)

# Boolean tells if a string is inside anther string:
# true
print("day" in "today")

# false
print("no" in "today")
